/// <summary>A borderless window whose pixels are whatever was drawn into them.</summary>

/// <b>Why this exists instead of a WinUI window.</b> The overlay has to be transparent
/// per pixel: the rope is a few thin strokes and a charm, and everything around them has
/// to be the desktop. A WinUI 3 window cannot do that. Its HWND is created without
/// <c>WS_EX_NOREDIRECTIONBITMAP</c>, so it owns an opaque redirection surface that no
/// XAML property can remove — a null background, a null <c>SystemBackdrop</c> and an
/// extended glass frame all paint onto that surface rather than replacing it, and the
/// window composites as a white rectangle with a perfectly correct rope inside it.
/// That was observed, not assumed.
///
/// <para><b>Why layered rather than DirectComposition.</b> Both give per-pixel alpha.
/// A composition swapchain keeps the pixels on the GPU and is the faster of the two, at
/// the cost of several undocumented-by-order COM vtables. A layered window costs one
/// read-back of the rendered frame per drawn frame and needs nothing but GDI. For a
/// window this size carrying a few hundred stroked segments — which stops redrawing
/// entirely the moment the rope settles — that read-back is not the expensive part, and
/// being able to read the code is worth more here than the frames it saves.</para>
///
/// <para>The surface is premultiplied BGRA because that is what
/// <c>UpdateLayeredWindow</c> blends and what Win2D renders natively. No conversion
/// happens anywhere between the drawing session and the desktop.</para>
